# PCR GUI
This is the repository holding all the files regarding the PCR GUI

# Overview
It is designed using QtDesigner and then the .ui file is imported in the main code.
Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) is a widely used technique in molecular biology that uses enzymes to amplify a specific DNA sequence of interest. It is used to generate large amounts of a specific DNA or RNA sequence from a small amount of template. PCR is a powerful tool that can be used to detect, diagnose and study genetic diseases, identify bacteria and viruses, and create copies of genes for study.  To work PCR, first the DNA template is amplified by taking advantage of the natural process of DNA replication. Primers, which are short pieces of DNA complementary to the sequence of interest, are added to the mixture, along with additional nucleotides. The primers bind to the template and the enzymes catalyze the process of replication, leading to multiple copies of the desired DNA sequence.
